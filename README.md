# SYRIATEL-CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION-PROJECT
This project aims to build a classifier to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. This is a binary classification problem. The project entails data preprocessing, analysis, model selection, and evaluation to achieve accurate and actionable predictions. The stakeholders here are the telecom business itself, interested in reducing the amount of money lost because of customers who don't stick around very long.
